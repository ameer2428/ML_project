# Loan-Approval-Prediction
A Financial domain project considers specific factors about a loan application to evaluate whether or not it should be granted.We will discuss data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature selection for the dataset.We use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis.We applied appropriate Machine Learning models such as KNN, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.We resampled based on the independent and dependent characteristics, resulting in oversampling of the minority class due to overfitting. We improve accuracy by resampling the data, as seen by the classification report.In this prediction, RandomForest outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 87%.Using this model, we will predict fresh data.
# Used-Cars-Price_Prediction
Explained about Used Car Price Prediction Machine Learning Model in Python.This Linear Regression Machine Learning Model is going to predict car price based on Features. Concepts from Data Extraction, Pre Processing of Data, Data Analysis, Removing Null Values, Removing Duplicate Values,to visualize the insights we go with EDA and  Creating a Linear Regression Machine Learning Model, Training Model, Predicting Values with Model and evaluating Model Predictions with Accuracy Score.
