# Loan-Approval-Prediction
A Financial domain project uses specific parameters about a loan application to determine whether or not the loan should get approved.We will cover data cleaning, preprocessing and feature selection of the dataset.To analyze we use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.we used appropriate Machine Learning models such as KNN, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.Based on the Independent and dependent features we resampled to oversampling of minority class because of the overfitting. We improve accuracy by resampling the data, which is shown by using classification report.In this prediction RandomForest is giving the best accuracy than other models, which is of 87% accuracy.By using this model we are going to predict the new data.
